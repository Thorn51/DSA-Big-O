## Big O Notation

| Big-O Notation              | n = 10 | n = 100 | n = 1000  |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------- | --------- |
| O(1) - Constant Time        | 1      | 1       | 1         |
| O(log n) - Logarithmic Time | 3      | 6       | 9         |
| O(n) - Linear Time          | 10     | 100     | 1000      |
| O(n^2) - Polynomial Time    | 100    | 10,000  | 1,000,000 |
| O(2^n) - Exponential Time   | 1024   | 2^100   | 2^1000    |

## Drills

**Environment -> https://thorn51.github.io/DSA-Big-O/**

The GitHub page has examples and drills from the Thinkful DSA module on Big-O.

After opening the page, open the developer tools. The examples and drills have corresponding functions. Call those functions in the console to see the results.

There is a note section under each to indicate which functions to call.

**Available Data**
There are a number of values and arrays available to test various examples and drills.

Values of Various Sizes

- Small Value -> `let smallValue = 2`
- Large Value -> `let largeValue = 2000`
- Extra Large Value -> `let extraLargeValue = 200000`

Arrays of Various Sizes

- `arrayThree` -> Sorted array with values 1-3
- `arrayTen` -> Sorted array with values 1-10
- `arrayOneHundred` -> You guessed it, sorted array with values 1-100
