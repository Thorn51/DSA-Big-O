    <h1>Big O Notation</h1>
    <p>Big O notation is a way of describing the time complexity of an algorithm. We use it to say how much time is needed for an algorithm to complete its work with a given input. This is important knowledge because an algorithm that is quick enough on a small input size may take so long as to be unusable on a larger input.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">How our code slows as data grows.</span></p>

    <section class="examples">
      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>In the following examples we'll use ticks to measure performance. This will demonstrate a relationship between the input size and the number of operations to complete the algorithm</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
        function sumArray(array) {
          let sum = 0, ticks=1;
          for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
              sum += array[i];
              ticks++;
          }
          return {result: sum, ticks};
        }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="note">
        <span class="bold"
          >NOTE:</span
        > Open the developer tools and call
        sumArray(arrayThree), sumArray(arrayTen), sumArray(arrayOneHundred).
      </p>
      <h2>Constant Time - O(1)</h2>
      <p>
        Constant time complexity is the "holy grail". No matter the size of your input, the algorithm will take the same amount of time to complete.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
        function getRandomItem(array) {
          let ticks = 0;
          // Get a random number and access that element in the array
          const item = array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
          ticks++;
          return {
              result: item,
              ticks: ticks
          };
        }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="note">
        <span class="bold"
          >NOTE:</span
        > Open the developer tools and call
        getRandomItem(arrayThree), getRandomItem(arrayTen), getRandomItem(arrayOneHundred). The number of ticks remain constant no matter the input size.
      </p>
      <h2>Logarithmic Time - O(log(n))</h2>
      <p>
        Logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) is the next best thing after constant time. While logarithmic time complexity algorithms do take longer with larger inputs, running time increases slowly. For instance, if myLogRunTimeAlgo takes 1 second to complete with an input of size 10, when we increase our input by 10x to 100, the running time only grows to 2 seconds. When we increase the input size to 1000, the time only grows to 3 seconds.
        <p><span class="bold">A characteristic of logarithmic algorithms is that they cut the problem in half.</span></p>
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>

              because no items in the array are less than `n`. */
          if (!arr.length || arr[0] >= n) {

                  to the right of `midIndex` are also greater than `n`, so

                  know that we need to check the items to the right of `midIndex`, so
                  we set `lowIndex` to the current value of `midIndex`, so that next

                  than or equal to `n`, we know that the item at `midIndex` is the last
                  item that's less than `n`, so we return `midIndex +  1` to get the total
                  number of items that are less than `n` */
              else {
                  ticks++;

      </p>
      <h2>Linear Time - O(n)</h2>
      <p>Algorithms with linear time complexity (O(n)) have running times that are directly proportional to the size (n) of the input. Given input a and input b, where b is twice as large as a, it will take a linear algorithm 2 times as long to process b compared to a.

        function findMin(array){
          let min = array[0], ticks = 1;
          for (let i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
              ticks++;
              if (array[i] < min) {
                  min = array[i];
              }
          }
          return {
              result: min,

        > Open the developer tools and call
        findMin(arrayThree), findMin(arrayTen), findMin(arrayOneHundred). The number of ticks grows linear to the input size, or the time it takes the algorithm to run is linear to the number of inputs. Notice that the number of ticks is directly proportional to the input size.
      </p>
      <h2>Polynomial Time - O(n^k)</h2>
      <p>
      An algorithm with polynomial time complexity has a running time that would be some input size n raised to some constant power k. The easiest way to understand polynomial time complexity is with nested loops. An algorithm that requires 2 levels of looping over an input would be O(n^2) while one requiring 3 levels of looping would be O(n^3). In both cases, we have polynomial time complexity.

      <h2>Exponential Time - O(2^n)</h2>
      <p><span class="bold">Bad, really bad, but thanfully difficult to do.</span></p>
      <p>
        Algorithms with exponential time complexity (O(2^n)) have running times that grow rapidly with any increase in input size. For an input of size 2, an exponential time algorithm will take 2^2 = 4 time. With an input of size 10, the same algorithm will take 2^10 = 1024 time, and with an input of size 100, it will take 2^100 = 1.26765060022823 * 1030 time.

      <h3>1. What is the Big O for this?</h3>
      <p class="question">
      Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        <span class="bold">Answer:</span> This would be O(1) constant time complexity. Given a big enough public address system the number of announcements doesn't change with the size of the crowd or input.
